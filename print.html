<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>One paragraph explanation of the feature.</p>
<h2 id="motivation"><a class="header" href="#motivation">Motivation</a></h2>
<p>Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?</p>
<h3 id="goals"><a class="header" href="#goals">Goals</a></h3>
<p>What is in scope for this work?</p>
<h3 id="non-goals"><a class="header" href="#non-goals">Non-Goals</a></h3>
<p>What is out of scope for this work?</p>
<h2 id="proposal"><a class="header" href="#proposal">Proposal</a></h2>
<p>This is the technical portion of the RFC. Explain the design in sufficient detail that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its interaction with other features is clear.</li>
<li>It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.</li>
<li>Corner cases are dissected by example.</li>
</ul>
<p>The section should return to the examples given in the guide-level explanation below, and explain more fully how the detailed proposal makes those examples work.</p>
<h3 id="values"><a class="header" href="#values">Values</a></h3>
<p>Describe what values does the proposed feature reflect. See <a href="docs/rfcs/0001-high-level-architecture.html">RFC-0001</a>.</p>
<h3 id="user-stories"><a class="header" href="#user-stories">User stories</a></h3>
<p>Explain what is the use case of the proposed feature and how it would benefit the user.</p>
<h3 id="guide-level-explanation"><a class="header" href="#guide-level-explanation">Guide-level explanation</a></h3>
<p>Explain the proposal as if it was already a feature of the project and this would be the documentation for that feature.</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing new named concepts.</li>
<li>Explaining the feature largely in terms of examples.</li>
<li>If applicable, provide sample error messages, deprecation warnings, or migration guidance.</li>
<li>If applicable, describe the differences between teaching this to a Racklet administrator versus a Racklet end user.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="risks-and-mitigations"><a class="header" href="#risks-and-mitigations">Risks and Mitigations</a></h3>
<p>What are the risks of this proposal and how do we mitigate.
Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="drawbacks"><a class="header" href="#drawbacks">Drawbacks</a></h2>
<p>Why should we <em>not</em> do this? Consider at least one drawback.</p>
<h2 id="rationale-and-alternatives"><a class="header" href="#rationale-and-alternatives">Rationale and alternatives</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?</li>
<li>What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?</li>
<li>What is the impact of not doing this?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prior-art"><a class="header" href="#prior-art">Prior art</a></h2>
<p>Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
A few examples of what this can include are:</p>
<ul>
<li>For community proposals: Is this done by some other community and what were their experiences with it?</li>
<li>For other teams: What lessons can we learn from what other communities have done here?</li>
<li>Papers: Are there any published papers or great posts that discuss this? If you have some relevant papers to refer to, this can serve as a more detailed theoretical background.</li>
</ul>
<p>This section is intended to encourage you as an author to think about the lessons from other projects and provide readers of your RFC with a fuller picture.
If there is no prior art, that is fine - your ideas are interesting to us regardless of whether they are brand new or adaptations from other projects.</p>
<h2 id="unresolved-questions"><a class="header" href="#unresolved-questions">Unresolved questions</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process before this gets merged?</li>
<li>What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the implementation of this feature before stabilization?</li>
<li>What related issues do you consider out of scope for this RFC that could be addressed in the future independently of the solution that comes out of this RFC?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="future-possibilities"><a class="header" href="#future-possibilities">Future possibilities</a></h2>
<p>Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would
be and how it would affect the project as a whole in a holistic
way. Try to use this section as a tool to more fully consider all possible
interactions with the project in your proposal.
Also consider how this all fits into the roadmap for the project.</p>
<p>This is also a good place to &quot;dump ideas&quot;, if they are out of scope for the
RFC you are writing but otherwise related.</p>
<p>If you have tried and cannot think of any future possibilities,
you may simply state that you cannot think of anything.</p>
<p>Note that having something written down in the future-possibilities section
is not a reason to accept the current or a future RFC; such notes should be
in the section on motivation or rationale in this or subsequent RFCs.
The section merely provides additional information.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-history"><a class="header" href="#implementation-history">Implementation History</a></h2>
<p>Major milestones in the lifecycle of a RFC should be tracked here.
Major milestones might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The status of the RFC has been changed or another major to the RFC has been accepted.</li>
<li>The first Racklet version including an initial version of the RFC is released.</li>
<li>The Racklet version where the RFC graduated to general availability is released.</li>
<li>The RFC has been retired or superseded.</li>

<h2 id="summary-1"><a class="header" href="#summary-1">Summary</a></h2>
<p>Racklet is a fully-integrated, miniature server rack. It is a scale model of a hyperscaler server rack loosely based on the <a href="https://www.opencompute.org/">Open Compute Project</a> (OCP) rack designs. It consists of several pluggable &quot;compute units&quot;, a <a href="https://www.opencompute.org/wiki/Hardware_Management/Open_RMC">Rack Management Controller</a> (RMC) and shared power delivery (the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busbar">busbar</a>). In addition, there is some functionality borrowed from <a href="https://www.opencompute.org/wiki/Telcos/Edge">OCP Edge Cloud implementations</a> in place, such as a common interconnect for the compute units (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Bus">SMBus</a>).</p>
<p>Physically a Racklet rack is a about the size of a 1 liter milk carton and hosts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-board_computer">single board computers</a> conforming to the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> 3/4 <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/hardware/raspberrypi/mechanical/README.md">form factor</a>. The defining features of Racklet compared to other &quot;Raspberry Pi clouds&quot; are the fully integrated and <strong>secure</strong> but still pluggable open source firmware/software/hardware solutions, and the scalability enabled by e.g. hotplug support as well as the inexpensive and available manufacturing techniques applied.</p>
<p>Racklet aims to inspire their users to explore how modern, advanced server architectures work in practice, in a tangible and educational way. With the new-found knowledge and inspiration, the user may apply their modernization skills on traditional server infrastructure, which improves the status quo and pushes the industry forward. The aim of the project is also to write modular pieces of software and firmware that can be re-used across a diverse set of systems, not only on Racklet itself.</p>
<p>Racklet is defined by its values and principles. Below you can read about the 9 values that shape this project, and what they mean in practice. One value to highlight here is <a href="docs/rfcs/0001-high-level-architecture.html#accessibility"><em>accessibility</em></a>. Racklet is 100% open source and should be accessible to a group as diverse as possible from all over the world. This means all parts of the system should be reproducible through open PCB designs, 3D-printed casing, and commodity, off-the-shelf hardware. We want to lower the barrier of entry for this domain.</p>
<p>In this RFC, we will outline what Racklet is, why create it (from the user's perspective), and the values and design constraints for the system.</p>
<p>In short, we'd like to say that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Racklet aims to be for Cloud Computing what Raspberry Pi is for Programming, and Arduino for Electronics</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have fun tinkering with it!</p>
<h2 id="motivation-1"><a class="header" href="#motivation-1">Motivation</a></h2>
<p><strong>Problem statement</strong> (choose the one that appeals to you):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Distributed systems of various kinds are steadily becoming the foundation for all important technological environments; and their backends require ever-increasing capacity. The world of cloud computing software is rapidly evolving towards dynamic, scalable and self-correcting systems. The amount of tools and services required to run high-performing cloud systems in a diverse range of environments are vast, and the integration between them complex<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#complex_cloud">1</a></sup>. Due to the complicated nature of this quickly-evolving cloud infrastructure, how can newcomers to the field of cloud computing get an idea of the landscape and workings of the systems in an effective way?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and/or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Empirically, it seems that many mainstream server and infrastructure provisioning guides (or even fully-integrated solutions) often don't put enough effort into securing the firmware stack of the server, but focus more on the layers above. This, in combination with the firmware being proprietary, often leads to situations of unknown/random bugs and security flaws (caused by the user due to insufficient knowledge, or flaws in the firmware without patched versions). Different pieces and layers of firmware doing the same things (and often too much) in subtly different ways, but without it being possible to only activate what you need or want to extend. Firmware written in C suffers from many common memory errors and even security flaws. Network booting of servers often stick to legacy and unreliable protocols like TFTP or similar, and skip any verification of the payload's integrity or authenticity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Proposed solution:</strong></p>
<p>As detailed in the <a href="docs/rfcs/0001-high-level-architecture.html#summary">Summary</a> section above, <em>&quot;Racklet is a fully-integrated, miniature server rack&quot;</em>. Building on top of good ideas and practices from <a href="https://www.opencompute.org/">OCP</a>, the <a href="https://slack.osfw.dev/">open source firmware community</a> (e.g. <a href="https://www.linuxboot.org/">LinuxBoot</a>, <a href="https://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot">u-boot</a>, <a href="https://www.trustedfirmware.org/">TF-A</a>, etc.), the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> educational model, and the advancements in writing secure system software and firmware with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, we think we can push the state of the art here, and educate newcomers to the field of secure and open source cloud computing at the same time.</p>
<p>As pointed out in the first problem statement, it can be challenging to &quot;get into&quot; to the server infrastructure world, especially if you want to run your own servers, due to a multitude of reasons, including complexity, lack of standardization at several layers of the stack, and cost. Through Racklet, we want to explore these venues in a tangible and low-cost way with the help of Raspberry Pi's (or alternate single board computers). It has been shown earlier that Raspberry Pis can be helpful for teaching cloud computing<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#kubecloud">2</a></sup>, hence we believe this could be a good fit.</p>
<p>The goal of the project is to be comprehensive and &quot;real-world&quot; enough to feature, at least conceptually, most of what you would find in a modern hyperscaler server infrastructure environment, but still clear, well-documented, and user-friendly enough to attract and welcome new, future talents to the server and firmware worlds.</p>

</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Pragmatism</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Focus</strong>: We only have a limited number of hours per day available, and should not spend all our time bikeshedding on some very non-significant detail.</li>
<li><strong>80-20</strong>: The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle">80-20%</a> rule is a good rule of thumb; the principle specifies that 80% of the output is generated from 20% of the inputs, and vice versa.</li>
<li><strong>Deadline</strong>: Our aspiration is to have some concrete to end-to-end prototype at the end of 2021.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Security by design</strong>: Security should be at the top of our minds at every decision we make. All design proposals must consider how the proposed change affects security concerns.</li>
<li><strong>No old/insecure protocols</strong>: We won't accept old/insecure protocols or ways of doing things (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_File_Transfer_Protocol">TFTP</a>). If we need to choose between interoperability and an insecure standard, we choose the more secure alternative, although that would mean we go against the norm.</li>
<li><strong>Improve Status Quo</strong>: We aspire to improve the status quo of &quot;secure-by-default&quot; solutions and concepts available out there. When we find ways to improve the state of the art, we preferably contribute patches to the respective upstream, otherwise, depending on the situation, build re-usable pieces of code that bring the industry forward.</li>
<li><strong>Defense in Depth</strong>: Design according to the &quot;Defense in Depth&quot; and &quot;Least Privilege&quot; methodologies. For example, the network is considered being an insecure channel, unless proven otherwise (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolev%E2%80%93Yao_model">Dolev-Yao adversary model</a>).</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Interoperability</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Openness</strong>: The truly most effective way of driving innovation forward in our minds is to define open (source) APIs, share code freely, and collaborate with fellow community members.</li>
<li><strong>De-facto standards</strong>: Implement well-known, existing and de-facto APIs instead of creating new ones when not needed.</li>
<li><strong>Declarative management</strong>: This is prominent in the cloud native space, but not so much in the embedded and firmware space. We believe declarative APIs are very useful and powerful, especially as it becomes &quot;obvious&quot; to write state reconciliation loops that follow the observe-diff-act pattern.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency</strong>: We want to expose consistent (declarative) APIs across the stack for the same &quot;look and feel&quot;. Use common meta-protocols like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML">YAML</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessibility / Reproducibility</strong> <span id="accessibility"></span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Open Source</strong>: Racklet is 100% open source software and hardware. Anyone can contribute, improve, fork and access the project. The dependencies of the project will also be openly accessible.</li>
<li><strong>Common off-the-shelf parts:</strong> Only use commonly available components that can be aquired in most parts of the world in a frictionless manner. In other words, no exotic hard-to-reproduce designs.</li>
<li><strong>3D printed parts</strong>: For non-off-the-shelf casing, we will provide 3D-printable designs that can easily be reproduced. Modelling is done in software that does not require paid-for subscriptions. Both printable STL output and the underlying save files are published to GitHub.</li>
<li><strong>Reproducible PCBs</strong>: For non-off-the-shelf PCBs, we will release schematics freely reproducible, made in open source software such as KiCAD. We will try to make sure that the PCB can be ordered from major PCB manufacturing/assembly services.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation</strong>: Documentation will be made available through <a href="https://readthedocs.org/">ReadTheDocs</a>, GitHub, code-autogenerated documentation services such as <a href="https://crates.io/">crates.io</a> and <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/">pkg.go.dev</a> as well as <a href="https://blog.racklet.io/">our blog</a> detailing the development process and important decisions made, featuring these design proposals. This documentation will lower the bar to entry in order to increase accessibility.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Modularity / Compatibility</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Modular design</strong>: Our designs, both hardware and software, strive to be as modular and extensible as possible. We strive to follow the Unix philosophy. This will allow for portability between e.g. different hardware modules implementing the same interfaces, or extensibility where the user demands other features than the default.</li>
<li><strong>Raspberry Pi compatibility</strong>: The Raspberry Pi physical design (mounting holes, GPIO layout, dimensions, <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats">HAT spec</a>) has established a &quot;de facto&quot; standard, and any other single-board computer implementing this  interface should be compatible with the system with minimal modifications.</li>
<li><strong>Portability</strong>: The code we write includes parameters for the platform it's running on so it is fairly easy to port the code to a new alternate architecture. We primarily support ARMv8 for the compute units.</li>
<li><strong>Loose coupling</strong>: We strive towards <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling">loose coupling</a>. This means that each component has as little knowledge of and hard dependencies on other components. Components should be easily interchangeable to alternate implementations.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Observability</strong>: All data logging/aggregating components in the system must expose metrics compliant to the <a href="https://openmetrics.io/">OpenMetrics</a> specification.</li>
<li><strong>Debuggability</strong>: We expose standardized debug headers (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_asynchronous_receiver-transmitter">UART</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JTAG">JTAG</a>) from our PCBs. Low-level firmware troubleshooting is accessible and documented for both our microcontrollers as well as the compute.</li>
<li><strong>Energy Consumption</strong>: Energy usage should be measured individually for the various components in the system, in order to transparently and automatically be able to track where power is consumed. This also allows for higher-order aggregation and data processing related to energy.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintainability / Upgradability</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hot swappability</strong>: Modules of the system (especially the compute) should be able to be hot-swapped without disturbing the operation of other modules in the rack while the rack is operating.</li>
<li><strong>Upgradability</strong>: The modularity of the system should allow that individual pieces of the system (e.g. compute, storage, network switches, power supplies) should be upgradable without having to disrupt the rest of the rack, or disregard existing, functioning parts. This will minimize E-waste produced over time.</li>
<li><strong>Auto-upgradability</strong>: It should be possible to enable automated (security) upgrades safely using e.g. <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/tech/ota/ab">A/B partitioning</a> schemes.</li>
<li><strong>One-time hardware setup</strong>: The hardware setup steps (3D-printing, PCB assembly, firmware flashing) are only performed once per rack. None of them are performed when dealing with software, even when resetting the entire cluster. This will allow for fast and less error-prone reconfigurations with faster setup/teardown cycle times.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minimalism</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Choose lightweight</strong>: If presented with a choice between something fully-featured (including features without clear justifications) and something lightweight, choose the lightweight variant.</li>
<li><strong>Drive by user demand</strong>: Before implementing features that might or might not be needed, discuss with the team and ask for user stories.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Affordability</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sensible rack cost</strong>: The price point of the Racklet Bill-of-Materials should be low enough to be accessible for hobbyists and educational organizations. Our target price range (VAT-exclusive, all essentials included) is 400-500€ per rack (containing 5 Pis). If this configuration is too costly it should be possible to switch parts out for a lower total price.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<!-- Rough cost estimate calculation for future reference: (40€/Pi + 15€/BMC + 7€/SD Card) × 5 Pis + (25€/SSD + 5€/SATA cable) × 4 compute Pis + 2€/Ethernet cable × 6  + 30€/switch + 5€/backplane = 477€. This needs to be followed up and adjusted over time. -->
<h3 id="user-perspectives"><a class="header" href="#user-perspectives">User Perspectives</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Main User Persona</strong>: <em>&quot;Racklet is for a student, hobbyist, teacher or industry professional who wants to learn and understand modern, increasingly important distributed and cloud computing skills to foster education, research and work opportunities.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="tangible-cloud-teaching"><a class="header" href="#tangible-cloud-teaching">Tangible Cloud Teaching</a></h4>
<p>A University distributed computing class could use one or multiple Racklets as a prototyping platform to enable fast learning augmented by practical training.</p>
<h4 id="mobile-cluster-for-conferences"><a class="header" href="#mobile-cluster-for-conferences">Mobile Cluster for Conferences</a></h4>
<p>Companies demoing their software and hardware at conferences could use this as an innovative way to showcase their solutions.</p>
<h4 id="ctf-contests"><a class="header" href="#ctf-contests">CTF contests</a></h4>
<p>As this aims to be a scale model of a real cloud environment, it forms a good target for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag#Computer-security">capture-the-flag hacking contests</a>.</p>
<h4 id="workshops"><a class="header" href="#workshops">Workshops</a></h4>
<p>In the same spirit as the Tangible Cloud Teaching use-case above, we anticipate it would also be a good fit for commercial trainings, when time is limited and you quickly need to demonstrate how some specific piece of technology works in detail. The instructor can easily engage their audience in a practical way.</p>
<h4 id="homelabs"><a class="header" href="#homelabs">Homelabs</a></h4>
<p>Hobbyists could use one or multiple Racklets to establish home infrastructure while learning more about and further developing the platform.</p>
<h4 id="research-and-development"><a class="header" href="#research-and-development">Research and Development</a></h4>
<p>Racklet can be used for Research and Development purposes in Computer Labs where some specific application's architecture is being validated on a real-world but inexpensive system. This is an alternative to data center simulation programs. Racklet captures the real-world aspects that a simulation might not take into account or can not realistically represent. Realistic outages and partial failure modes (e.g. power outages or network partitions) can easily be applied to the system in order to research how the tested application reacts.</p>
<h3 id="user-goals"><a class="header" href="#user-goals">User Goals</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Achieve user goals through containers and Kubernetes</strong>: The user wants to use containers and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> as their preferred way of running applications, and hence some base functionality of that should be provided in a &quot;batteries included, but swappable&quot;-sense. At the end of the day, we're building this project so that the user can build something nice on top of it through these standard interfaces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fast Reconfiguration / Turn-around Time</strong>: The user wants to configure their hardware once, and after that be able to set up and/or recreate the whole software stack from the ground up multiple times over with minimal hassle. For example, an educator may want to rebuild the rack configuration, trusted certificates, etc. or do a &quot;factory reset&quot; for every class/workshop they run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Secure Firmware<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#trusted_firmware">3</a></sup> and Software Updates</strong>: When the user gets notified that a new release is available, the user <em>doesn't</em> want to do it the &quot;classical&quot; way of downloading some hex binary and flashing it manually for each server. Instead, they want the upgrades to be atomic (e.g. A/B partitioning), secure (payload is signed), automated and defend against common upgrading attacks (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downgrade_attack" title="This is for software protocols such as TLS, but the same principle applies to firmware as well.">rollback attack</a>). Optionally, automatic deployment of upgrades can be enabled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Network Boot in an Zero-Trust Environment</strong>: The user should feel ready to plug Racklet in to (almost) any existing network, without the system interfering with existing devices on the network or vice versa. This goes strongly in hand with #3 as ensuring security, especially in the boot and upgrade process, is of paramount importance<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#security">4</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>End-to-end encryption and authentication</strong>: The user wants to feel comfortable running software on top of their Racklet without worrying about e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">MITM</a> attacks in the surrounding untrusted network it is connected to. Hence, all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP/IP</a> traffic should be end-to-end encrypted, authenticated or preferably, both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hot swappability</strong>: The user wants to be able to upgrade their racks often for newer hardware as they enter the market. The user also wants to be able to maintain and service the rack while it is running, and dynamically expand capacity at runtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Keep track of power usage and efficiency</strong>: For educational purposes and intelligent power control, it is important to know how compute utilization translates to power consumption across the system. The user wants transparently reported metrics so that they can analyze the data and utilize higher-level power control routines to optimize power draw.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Physical portability</strong>: Racklet should be lightweight enough to be carried by hand and should not require specialized equipment or disassembly for transportation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Commodity Power and I/O</strong>: The user wants to be able to utilize commodity resources they already have at hand, instead of needing to buy specialized equipment only for Racklet. Examples of these commodities include: Laptop chargers instead of a custom power cable/transformer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB">USB</a> instead of some proprietary high-speed interconnect, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#Ethernet">5</a></sup> switches &amp; cables instead of e.g. expensive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_form-factor_pluggable_transceiver">SFP+</a>.</p>

<h2 id="design-details"><a class="header" href="#design-details">Design Details</a></h2>
<p>The only design detail in-scope for this document is defining the layers of the system at a high level.</p>
<h3 id="high-level-layers"><a class="header" href="#high-level-layers">High-level Layers</a></h3>
<p>The following section will go through the various layers of the system and the requirements/contract of each of the items.</p>
<p><img src="docs/rfcs/0001-layers.png" alt="Racklet Layers" /></p>
<h4 id="layer-1-structural"><a class="header" href="#layer-1-structural">Layer 1: Structural</a></h4>
<p>This layer of the &quot;stack&quot; consists mainly of the 3D-printed casing and trays of the rack. The Ethernet switch optionally attached on the side of the rack can also be considered a structural item.</p>
<h4 id="layer-2-electrical"><a class="header" href="#layer-2-electrical">Layer 2: Electrical</a></h4>
<p>This layer consists of compute capacity (e.g. a Raspberry Pi with an attached SSD), our reproducible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface">Baseboard Management Controller</a> PCB attached to the it in some way (as also can be found in mainstream servers), and our reproducible backplane PCB/wiring which feeds the common <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busbar">busbar</a> power rails, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Bus">SMBus</a> interconnect between compute units.</p>
<h4 id="layer-3-firmware"><a class="header" href="#layer-3-firmware">Layer 3: Firmware</a></h4>
<p>The firmware layer is defined as the code that is running in &quot;bare metal&quot; environments, i.e. before the primary OS of the compute has been loaded, or on the BMC <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller">microcontroller</a>. Examples of code that is capable of (and specialized at) running before the primary OS includes the (proprietary) <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware">Raspberry Pi firmware</a>, <a href="https://www.linuxboot.org/">LinuxBoot</a>, <a href="https://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot">u-boot</a>, and <a href="https://www.trustedfirmware.org/">TF-A</a>. We strive to use open source <a href="https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/">Embedded Rust</a> due to the language's suitability for memory safe firmware and good support for most popular microcontrollers.</p>
<h4 id="layer-4-system-software"><a class="header" href="#layer-4-system-software">Layer 4: System Software</a></h4>
<p>The system software includes everything the system needs to run in order to fulfil the user goals. All applications at this layer are built for and depend on Linux. As per above, we expect the user to utilize <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, and hence there is a default (but replaceable) installation of that. We will also pre-install a (configurable) operating system (OS), e.g. <a href="https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket">Bottlerocket</a>, so that the user can get going without too much preliminary work. In addition, we will implement the <a href="https://www.opencompute.org/wiki/Hardware_Management/Open_RMC">Rack Management Controller</a> features at this level.</p>
<h4 id="layer-5-user-software"><a class="header" href="#layer-5-user-software">Layer 5: User Software</a></h4>
<p>At this layer are the user-deployable workloads running in containers, we consider them as &quot;user-space applications&quot;. This layer is not part of the Racklet project, it is entirely user-defined. This is also a good place for users to extend Racklet and add extra functionality of their liking.</p>
<h3 id="test-plan"><a class="header" href="#test-plan">Test Plan</a></h3>
<p>Unit tests will be created for individual software components of the system. Integration tests will be created for cross-component communications. Automated end-to-end tests will be conducted by a physical Racklet instance that is &quot;upgraded&quot; to the latest development version continuously, reporting back feedback. This way we will assure the stability and resilience of the software/firmware stack.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we will rely on the developer community to test out many different hardware, software and firmware combinations other than the reference implementation.</p>
<h3 id="graduation-criteria"><a class="header" href="#graduation-criteria">Graduation Criteria</a></h3>
<p>For this project to be considered successful and graduated, we mandate the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a vibrant open source community around Racklet</li>
<li>Racklet fulfils all of the above mentioned <a href="docs/rfcs/0001-high-level-architecture.html#User-Goals">User Goals</a> to a sufficient degree (as determined by the RFCs addressing respective functionality)</li>
<li>It has been end-to-end tested and verified working by following the documentation by someone external to the core contributors team</li>
<li>It has been successfully used for educational purposes, e.g. in a university course and/or a workshop</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="implementation-history-1"><a class="header" href="#implementation-history-1">Implementation History</a></h2>

<p>For example the <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-eeprom">1st stage bootloader of the Raspberry Pi 4</a> is currently closed source software which we cannot audit or modify, and hence cannot use as a &quot;complete end to end&quot; hardware root of trust. However, such non-idealities don't stop us from getting as close as possible to full hardware root of trust, and more importantly, conceptually being consistent in the way we work with these SBCs and &quot;normal&quot; servers.</p>

<h3 id="contributing-your-code"><a class="header" href="#contributing-your-code">Contributing your code</a></h3>
<p>The process to contribute code to Racklet is generally as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the project on <a href="https://github.com/racklet/racklet">GitHub</a> and click the <code>Fork</code> button in the top-right corner. This will create your own copy of the repository in your personal account.</li>
<li>Using standard <code>git</code> workflow, <code>clone</code> your fork, make your changes and then <code>commit</code> and <code>push</code> them to <em>your</em> repository.</li>
<li>Go back to <a href="https://github.com/racklet/racklet">GitHub</a>, select <code>Pull requests</code> from the top bar and click
<code>New pull request</code> to the right. Select the <code>compare across forks</code> link. This will show repositories in addition to branches.</li>
<li>From the <code>head repository</code> dropdown, select your forked repository. If you made a new branch, select it in the <code>compare</code> dropdown.
You should always target <code>racklet/racklet</code> and <code>main</code> as the base repository and branch.</li>
<li>With your changes visible, click <code>Create pull request</code>. Give it a short, descriptive title and write a comment describing your changes.
Click <code>Create pull request</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>That's it! Maintainers follow pull requests closely and will add the correct labels and milestones.
After a maintainer's review small changes/improvements could be requested, don't worry, feedback can
be easily addressed by performing the requested changes and doing a <code>commit</code> and <code>push</code>. Your new
changes will automatically be added to the pull request.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or need help, don't hesitate to ask on our <a href="https://github.com/racklet/racklet/discussions">GitHub Discussions</a>, through <a href="https://github.com/racklet/racklet/issues">GitHub issues</a>,
