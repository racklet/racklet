    CONTRIBUTING.md is a copy of to the top-level CONTRIBUTING.md (can't symlink outside of docs/ as per linkcheck)
    CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md is a copy of to the top-level CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (can't symlink outside of docs/ as per linkcheck)
    CONTRIBUTING.md links to LICENSE, hence we also copy that file over to the site (to not have a broken link). However, it is not displayed on the website, but instead available as a downloaded file.
    mdbook.md is a symlink to the README.md of this docs/ directory as mdbook.html better describes the page contents
